  window.lenses = ["# Lens #1: The Lens of Essential Experience\nTo use this lens, you stop thinking about your game and start thinking about the experience of the player. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What experience do I want the player to have?\n- What is essential to that experience?\n- How can my game capture that essence?\n\nIf there is a big difference between the experience you want to create and the one you are actually creating, your game needs to change: You need to clearly state the essential experience you desire, and find as many ways as possible to instill this essence into your game.", "# Lens #2: The Lens of Surprise\nSurprise is so basic that we can easily forget about it. Use this lens to remind yourself to fill your game with interesting surprises. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What will surprise players when they play my game?\n- Does the story in my game have surprises? Do the game rules? Does the artwork? The technology?\n- Do your rules give players ways to surprise each other?\n- Do your rules give players ways to surprise themselves?\n\nSurprise is a crucial part of all entertainment — it is at the root of humor, strategy, and problem solving. Our brains are hardwired to enjoy surprises. In an experiment where participants received sprays of sugar water or plain water into their mouths, the participants who received random sprays consid- ered the experience much more pleasurable than participants who received the sprays according to a fixed pattern, even though the same amount of sugar was delivered. In other experiments, brain scans revealed that even during unpleasant surprises, the pleasure centers of the brain are triggered.", "# Lens #3: The Lens of Fun\nFun is desirable in nearly every game, although sometimes fun defies analysis. To maximize your game’s fun, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What parts of my game are fun? Why?\n- What parts need to be more fun?", "# Lens #4: The Lens of Curiosity\nTo use this lens, think about the player’s true motivations — not just the goals your game has set forth, but the reason the player wants to achieve those goals. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What questions does my game put into the player’s mind?\n- What am I doing to make them care about these questions?\n- What can I do to make them invent even more questions?\n\nFor example, a maze-finding videogame might have a time-limit goal such that at each level, players are trying to answer the question: “Can I find my way through this maze in 30 seconds?” A way to make them care more would be to play interesting animations when they solve each maze, so players might also ask the question: “I wonder what the next animation will be?”", "# Lens #5: The Lens of Endogenous Value\nTo use this lens, think about your players’ feelings about items, objects, and scoring in your game. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What is valuable to the players in my game?\n- How can I make it more valuable to them?\n- What is the relationship between value in the game and the player’s motivations?\n\nRemember, the value of the items and score in the game is a direct reflection of how much players care about succeeding in your game. By thinking about what the players really care about and why, you can often get insights about how your game can improve.", "# Lens #6: The Lens of Problem Solving\nTo use this lens, think about the problems your players must solve to suc- ceed at your game, for every game has problems to solve. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What problems does my game ask the player to solve?\n- Are there hidden problems to solve that arise as part of gameplay?\n- How can my game generate new problems so that players keep coming back?", "# Lens #7: The Lens of the Elemental Tetrad\nTo use this lens, take stock of what your game is truly made of. Consider each element separately, and then all of them together as a whole.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- Is my game design using elements of all four types?\n- Could my design be improved by enhancing elements in one or more of the categories?\n- Are the four elements in harmony, reinforcing each other, and working together toward a common theme?", "# Lens #8: The Lens of Holographic Design\nTo use this lens, you must see everything in your game at once: the four ele- ments and the player experience, as well as how they interrelate. It is accepta- ble to shift your focus from skin to skeleton and back again, but it is far better to view your game and experience holographically.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- What elements of the game make the experience enjoyable?\n- What elements of the game detract from the experience?\n- How can I change game elements to improve the experience?", "# Lens #9: The Lens of Unification\nTo use this lens, consider the reason behind it all. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What is my theme?\n- Am I using every means possible to reinforce that theme?\n\nThe Lens of Unification works very well with the Lens of the Elemental Tetrad. Use the tetrad to separate out the elements of your game, so you can more easily study them from the perspective of a unified theme.", "# Lens #10: The Lens of Resonance\nTo use the Lens of Resonance, you must look for hidden power. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What is it about my game that feels powerful and special?\n- When I describe my game to people, what ideas get them really excited?\n- If I had no constraints of any kind, what would this game be like?\n- I have certain instincts about how this game should be. What is driving those instincts?\n\nThe Lens of Resonance is a quiet, delicate instrument. It is a tool for listening to yourself and listening to others. We bury important things deep inside our- selves, and when something causes them to resonate, it shakes us to our very core. The fact that these things are hidden gives them power, but also makes them hard for us to find."];
