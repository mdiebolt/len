  window.lenses = ["# Lens #1: The Lens of Essential Experience\nTo use this lens, you stop thinking about your game and start thinking about the experience of the player. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What experience do I want the player to have?\n- What is essential to that experience?\n- How can my game capture that essence?\n\nIf there is a big difference between the experience you want to create and the one you are actually creating, your game needs to change: You need to clearly state the essential experience you desire, and find as many ways as possible to instill this essence into your game.", "# Lens #2: The Lens of Surprise\nSurprise is so basic that we can easily forget about it. Use this lens to remind yourself to fill your game with interesting surprises. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What will surprise players when they play my game?\n- Does the story in my game have surprises? Do the game rules? Does the artwork? The technology?\n- Do your rules give players ways to surprise each other?\n- Do your rules give players ways to surprise themselves?\n\nSurprise is a crucial part of all entertainment — it is at the root of humor, strategy, and problem solving. Our brains are hardwired to enjoy surprises. In an experiment where participants received sprays of sugar water or plain water into their mouths, the participants who received random sprays consid- ered the experience much more pleasurable than participants who received the sprays according to a fixed pattern, even though the same amount of sugar was delivered. In other experiments, brain scans revealed that even during unpleasant surprises, the pleasure centers of the brain are triggered.", "# Lens #3: The Lens of Fun\nFun is desirable in nearly every game, although sometimes fun defies analysis. To maximize your game’s fun, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What parts of my game are fun? Why?\n- What parts need to be more fun?", "# Lens #4: The Lens of Curiosity\nTo use this lens, think about the player’s true motivations — not just the goals your game has set forth, but the reason the player wants to achieve those goals. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What questions does my game put into the player’s mind?\n- What am I doing to make them care about these questions?\n- What can I do to make them invent even more questions?\n\nFor example, a maze-finding videogame might have a time-limit goal such that at each level, players are trying to answer the question: “Can I find my way through this maze in 30 seconds?” A way to make them care more would be to play interesting animations when they solve each maze, so players might also ask the question: “I wonder what the next animation will be?”", "# Lens #5: The Lens of Endogenous Value\nTo use this lens, think about your players’ feelings about items, objects, and scoring in your game. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What is valuable to the players in my game?\n- How can I make it more valuable to them?\n- What is the relationship between value in the game and the player’s motivations?\n\nRemember, the value of the items and score in the game is a direct reflection of how much players care about succeeding in your game. By thinking about what the players really care about and why, you can often get insights about how your game can improve.", "# Lens #6: The Lens of Problem Solving\nTo use this lens, think about the problems your players must solve to suc- ceed at your game, for every game has problems to solve. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What problems does my game ask the player to solve?\n- Are there hidden problems to solve that arise as part of gameplay?\n- How can my game generate new problems so that players keep coming back?", "# Lens #7: The Lens of the Elemental Tetrad\nTo use this lens, take stock of what your game is truly made of. Consider each element separately, and then all of them together as a whole.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- Is my game design using elements of all four types?\n- Could my design be improved by enhancing elements in one or more of the categories?\n- Are the four elements in harmony, reinforcing each other, and working together toward a common theme?", "# Lens #8: The Lens of Holographic Design\nTo use this lens, you must see everything in your game at once: the four ele- ments and the player experience, as well as how they interrelate. It is accepta- ble to shift your focus from skin to skeleton and back again, but it is far better to view your game and experience holographically.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- What elements of the game make the experience enjoyable?\n- What elements of the game detract from the experience?\n- How can I change game elements to improve the experience?", "# Lens #9: The Lens of Unification\nTo use this lens, consider the reason behind it all. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What is my theme?\n- Am I using every means possible to reinforce that theme?\n\nThe Lens of Unification works very well with the Lens of the Elemental Tetrad. Use the tetrad to separate out the elements of your game, so you can more easily study them from the perspective of a unified theme.", "# Lens #10: The Lens of Resonance\nTo use the Lens of Resonance, you must look for hidden power. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What is it about my game that feels powerful and special?\n- When I describe my game to people, what ideas get them really excited?\n- If I had no constraints of any kind, what would this game be like?\n- I have certain instincts about how this game should be. What is driving those instincts?\n\nThe Lens of Resonance is a quiet, delicate instrument. It is a tool for listening to yourself and listening to others. We bury important things deep inside our- selves, and when something causes them to resonate, it shakes us to our very core. The fact that these things are hidden gives them power, but also makes them hard for us to find.", "# Lens #11: The Lens of Infinite Inspiration\n> When you know how to listen, everybody is the guru.\n> – Ram Dass To you use this lens, stop looking at your game, and stop looking at games\n> like it. Instead, look everywhere else.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- What is an experience I have had in my life that I would want to share with others?\n- In what small way can I capture the essence of that experience and put it into my game?", "# Lens #12: The Lens of the Problem Statement\nTo use this lens, think of your game as the solution to a problem. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What problem, or problems, am I really trying to solve?\n- Have I been making assumptions about this game that really have nothing to do with its true purpose?\n- Is a game really the best solution? Why?\n- How will I be able to tell if the problem is solved?\n\nDefining the constraints and goals for your game as a problem statement can help move you to a clear game design much more quickly.", "# Lens #13: The Lens of the Eight Filters\nTo use this lens, you must consider the many constraints your design must satisfy. You can only call your design finished when it can pass through all eight filters without requiring a change.\n\nAsk yourself the eight key questions:\n\n- Does this game feel right?\n- Will the intended audience like this game enough?\n- Is this a well-designed game?\n- Is this game novel enough?\n- Will this game sell?\n- Is it technically possible to build this game?\n- Does this game meet our social and community goals?\n- Do the playtesters enjoy this game enough?\n\nIn some situations, there may be still more filters; for example, an educa- tional game will also have to answer questions like “Does this game teach what it is supposed to?” If your design requires more filters, don’t neglect them.", "# Lens #14: The Lens of Risk Mitigation\nTo use this lens, stop thinking positively, and start seriously considering the things that could go horribly wrong with your game.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- What could keep this game from being great?\n- How can we stop that from happening?\n\nRisk management is hard. It means you have to face up to the problems you would most like to avoid, and solve them immediately. But if you disci- pline yourself to do it, you’ll loop more times, and more usefully, and get a better game as a result. It is tempting to ignore potential problems and just work on the parts of your game you feel most confident about. You must resist this temptation and focus on the parts of your game that are in danger.", "# Lens #15: The Lens of the Toy\nTo use this lens, stop thinking about whether your game is fun to play, and start thinking about whether it is fun to play with.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- If my game had no goal, would it be fun at all? If not, how can I change that?\n- When people see my game, do they want to start interacting with it, even before they know what to do? If not, how can I change that?\n\nThere are two ways to use the Lens of the Toy. One way is to use it on an existing game, to figure out how to add more toy-like qualities to it — that is, how to make it more approachable, and more fun to manipulate. But the sec- ond way, the braver way, is to use it to invent and create new toys before you even have any idea what games will be played with them. This is risky if you are on a schedule — but if you are not, it can be a great “divining rod” to help you find wonderful games you might not have discovered otherwise.", "# Lens #16: The Lens of the Player\nTo use this lens, stop thinking about your game, and start thinking about your player.\n\nAsk yourself these questions about the people who will play your game:\n\n- In general, what do they like?\n- What don’t they like? Why?\n- What do they expect to see in a game?\n- If I were in their place, what would I want to see in a game?\n- What would they like or dislike about my game in particular?\n\nA good game designer should always be thinking of the player, and should be an advocate for the player. Skilled designers hold The Lens of the Player and the Lens of Holographic Design in the same hand, thinking about the player, the experience of the game, and the mechanics of the game all at the same time. Thinking about the player is useful, but even more useful is watch- ing them play your game. The more you observe them playing, the more eas- ily you’ll be able to predict what they are going to enjoy.", "# Lens #17: The Lens of Pleasure\nTo use this lens, think about the kinds of pleasure your game does and does not provide.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- What pleasures does your game give to players? Can these be improved?\n- What pleasures are missing from your experience? Why? Can they be added?\n\nUltimately, the job of a game is to give pleasure. By going through lists of known pleasures, and considering how well your game delivers each one, you may be inspired to make changes to your game that will increase your players’ enjoyment. Always be on the lookout, though, for unique, unclassified pleas- ures not found in most games — for one of these might be what gives your game the unique quality it needs.", "# Lens #18: The Lens of Flow\nTo use this lens, consider what is holding your player’s focus. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- Does my game have clear goals? If not, how can I fix that?\n- Are the goals of the player the same goals I intended?\n- Are there parts of the game that distract players to the point they forget their goal? If so, can these distractions be reduced, or tied into the game goals?\n- Does my game provide a steady stream of not-too-easy, not-too-hard chal- lenges, taking into account the fact that the player’s skills may be gradually improving?\n- Are the player’s skills improving at the rate I had hoped? If not, how can I change that?", "# Lens #19: The Lens of Needs\nTo use this lens, stop thinking about your game, and start thinking about what basic human needs it fulfills.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- On which levels of Maslow’s hierarchy is my game operating?\n- How can I make my game fulfill more basic needs than it already is?\n- On the levels my game is currently operating, how can it fulfill those needs even better?\n\nIt sounds strange to talk about a game fulfilling basic human needs, but every- thing that people do is an attempt to fulfill these needs in some way. And keep in mind, some games fulfill needs better than others — your game can’t just promise the need, it must deliver fulfillment of the need. If a player imagines that playing your game is going to make them feel better about themselves, or get to know their friends better, and your game doesn’t deliver on these needs, your player will move on to a game that does.", "# Lens #20: The Lens of Judgment\nTo decide if your game is a good judge of the players, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What does your game judge about the players?\n- How does it communicate this judgment?\n- Do players feel the judgment is fair?\n- Do they care about the judgment?\n- Does the judgment make them want to improve?", "# Lens #21: The Lens of Functional Space\nTo use this lens, think about the space in which your game really takes place when all surface elements are stripped away.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- Is the space of this game discrete or continuous?\n- How many dimensions does it have?\n- What are the boundaries of the space?\n- Are there sub-spaces? How are they connected?\n- Is there more than one useful way to abstractly model the space of this game?", "# Lens #22: The Lens of Dynamic State\nTo use this lens, think about what information changes during your game, and who is aware of it. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What are the objects in my game?\n- What are the attributes of the objects?\n- What are the possible states for each attribute? What triggers the state changes for each attribute?\n- What state is known by the game only?\n- What state is known by all players?\n- What state is known by some, or only one player?\n- Would changing who knows what state improve my game in some way?\n\nGame playing is decision making. Decisions are made based on information. Deciding the different attributes, their states, and who knows about them is core to the mechanics of your game. Small changes to who knows what infor- mation can radically change a game, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. Who knows about what attributes can even change over the course of a game — a great way to create drama in your game is to make an impor- tant piece of private information suddenly become public.", "# Lens #23: The Lens of Emergence\nTo make sure your game has interesting qualities of emergence, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- How many verbs do my players have?\n- How many objects can each verb act on?\n- How many ways can players achieve their goals?\n- How many subjects do the players control?\n- How do side effects change constraints?", "# Lens #24: The Lens of Action\nTo use this lens, think about what your players can do and what they can’t, and why.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- What are the operational actions in my game?\n- What are the resultant actions?\n- What resultant actions would I like to see? How can I change my game in order to make those possible?\n- Am I happy with the ratio of resultant to operational actions?\n- What actions do players wish they could do in my game that they cannot? Can I somehow enable these, either as operational or resultant actions?\n\nA game without actions is like a sentence without verbs — nothing happens. Deciding the actions in your game will be the most fundamental decision you can make as a game designer. Tiny changes to these actions will have tre- mendous ripple effects with the possibility of either creating marvelous emer- gent gameplay or making a game that is predictable and tedious. Choose your actions carefully, and learn to listen to your game and your players to learn what is made possible by your choices.", "# Lens #25: The Lens of Goals\nTo ensure the goals of your game are appropriate and well-balanced, ask your- self these questions:\n\n- What is the ultimate goal of my game?\n- Is that goal clear to players?\n- If there is a series of goals, do the players understand that?\n- Are the different goals related to each other in a meaningful way?\n- Are my goals concrete, achievable, and rewarding?\n- Do I have a good balance of short- and long-term goals?\n- Do players have a chance to decide on their own goals?", "# Lens #26: The Lens of Rules\nTo use this lens, look deep into your game, until you can make out its most basic structure. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What are the foundational rules of my game? How do these differ from the operational rules?\n- Are there “laws” or “house rules” that are forming as the game develops? Should these be incorporated into my game directly?\n- Are there different modes in my game? Do these modes make things sim- pler, or more complex? Would the game be better with fewer modes? More modes?\n- Who enforces the rules?\n- Are the rules easy to understand, or is there confusion about them? If there is confusion, should I fix it by changing the rules or by explaining them more clearly?\n\nThere is a common misconception that designers make games by sitting down and writing a set of rules. This usually isn’t how it happens at all. A game’s rules are arrived at gradually and experimentally. The designer’s mind gener- ally works in the domain of “operational rules,” occasionally switching to the perspective of “foundational rules” when thinking about how to change or improve the game. The “written rules” usually come toward the end, once the game is playable. Part of the designer’s job is to make sure there are rules that cover every circumstance. Be sure to take careful notes as you playtest, because it is during these tests that holes in your rules will appear — if you just patch them quickly and don’t make a note, the same hole will just show up again later. A game is its rules — give them the time and consideration that they deserve.", "# Lens #27: The Lens of Skill\nTo use this lens, stop looking at your game, and start looking at the skills you are asking of your players.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- What skills does my game require from the player?\n- Are there categories of skill that this game is missing?\n- Which skills are dominant?\n- Are these skills creating the experience I want?\n- Are some players much better at these skills than others? Does this make the game feel unfair?\n- Can players improve their skills with practice?\n- Does this game demand the right level of skill?\n\nExercising skills can be a joyful thing — it is one of the reasons that people love games. Of course, it is only joyful if the skills are interesting and reward- ing, and if the challenge level strikes that ideal balance between “too easy” and “too hard.” Even dull skills (such as pushing buttons) can be made more interesting by dressing them up as virtual skills and providing the right level of challenge. Use this lens as a window into the experience the player is having. Because skills do so much to define experience, the Lens of Skill works quite well in conjunction with Lens #1: The Lens of Essential Experience.", "# Lens #28: The Lens of Expected Value\nTo use this lens, think about the chance of different events occurring in your game, and what those mean to your player.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- What is the actual chance of a certain event occurring?\n- What is the perceived chance?\n- What value does the outcome of that event have? Can the value be quanti- fied? Are there intangible aspects of value that I am not considering?\n- Each action a player can take has a different expected value when I add up all the possible outcomes. Am I happy with these values? Do they give the player interesting choices? Are they too rewarding, or too punishing?\n\nExpected value is one of your most valuable tools for analyzing game balance. The challenge of using it is finding a way to numerically represent everything that can happen to a player. Gaining and losing money is easy to represent. But what is the numerical value of “boots of speed” that let you run faster, or a “warp gate” that lets you skip two levels? These are difficult to quantify per- fectly — but that doesn’t mean you can’t take a guess. As we’ll see in Chapter 11, as you go through multiple iterations of game testing, tweaking parameters and values in your game, you will also be tweaking your own estimations of the values of different outcomes. Quantifying these less tangible elements can be quite enlightening, because it makes you think concretely about what is valuable to the player and why — and this concrete knowledge will put you in control of the balance of your game.", "# Lens #29: The Lens of Chance\nTo use this lens focus on the parts of your game that involve randomness and risk, keeping in mind that those two things are not the same.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- What in my game is truly random? What parts just feel random?\n- Does the randomness give the players positive feelings of excitement and challenge, or does it give them negative feelings of hopelessness and lack of control?\n- Would changing my probability distribution curves improve my game?\n- Do players have the opportunity to take interesting risks in the game?\n- What is the relationship between chance and skill in my game? Are there ways I can make random elements feel more like the exercise of a skill? Are there ways I can make exercising skills feel more like risk-taking?\n\nRisk and randomness are like spices. A game without any hint of them can be completely bland, but put in too much and they overwhelm everything else. But get them just right, and they bring out the flavor of everything else in your game. Unfortunately, using them in your game is not as simple as sprinkling them on top. You must look into your game to see where elements of risk and randomness naturally arise, and then decide how you can best tame them to do your bidding. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that elements of chance only occur around die rolls or randomly generated numbers. On the contrary, you can find them wherever a player encounters the unknown.", "# Lens #30: The Lens of Fairness\nTo use the Lens of Fairness, think carefully about the game from each player’s point of view. Taking into account each player’s skill level, find a way to give each player a chance of winning that each will consider to be fair.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- Should my game be symmetrical? Why?\n- Should my game be asymmetrical? Why?\n- Which is more important: that my game is a reliable measure of who has the most skill, or that it provide an interesting challenge to all players?\n- If I want players of different skill levels to play together, what means will I use to make the game interesting and challenging for everyone?\n\nFairness can be a slippery subject. There are some cases where one side has an advantage over the other, and the game still seems fair. Sometimes this is so that players of unequal skill can play together, but there can be other reasons. In the game Alien vs. Predator, for example, it is generally recognized that in multiplayer mode, Predators have a significant advantage over the Aliens. Players do not consider it to be unfair, however, because it is in keeping with the Alien vs. Predator story world, and they accept that if they play as an Alien, they will be at a disadvantage and will need to compensate for that with extra skill. It is a badge of pride among players to be able to win the game when playing as an Alien."];
