  window.lenses = ["# Lens #1: The Lens of Essential Experience\nTo use this lens, you stop thinking about your game and start thinking about the experience of the player. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What experience do I want the player to have?\n- What is essential to that experience?\n- How can my game capture that essence?\n\nIf there is a big difference between the experience you want to create and the one you are actually creating, your game needs to change: You need to clearly state the essential experience you desire, and find as many ways as possible to instill this essence into your game.", "# Lens #2: The Lens of Surprise\nSurprise is so basic that we can easily forget about it. Use this lens to remind yourself to fill your game with interesting surprises. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What will surprise players when they play my game?\n- Does the story in my game have surprises? Do the game rules? Does the artwork? The technology?\n- Do your rules give players ways to surprise each other?\n- Do your rules give players ways to surprise themselves?\n\nSurprise is a crucial part of all entertainment — it is at the root of humor, strategy, and problem solving. Our brains are hardwired to enjoy surprises. In an experiment where participants received sprays of sugar water or plain water into their mouths, the participants who received random sprays consid- ered the experience much more pleasurable than participants who received the sprays according to a fixed pattern, even though the same amount of sugar was delivered. In other experiments, brain scans revealed that even during unpleasant surprises, the pleasure centers of the brain are triggered.", "# Lens #3: The Lens of Fun\nFun is desirable in nearly every game, although sometimes fun defies analysis. To maximize your game’s fun, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What parts of my game are fun? Why?\n- What parts need to be more fun?", "# Lens #4: The Lens of Curiosity\nTo use this lens, think about the player’s true motivations — not just the goals your game has set forth, but the reason the player wants to achieve those goals. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What questions does my game put into the player’s mind?\n- What am I doing to make them care about these questions?\n- What can I do to make them invent even more questions?\n\nFor example, a maze-finding videogame might have a time-limit goal such that at each level, players are trying to answer the question: “Can I find my way through this maze in 30 seconds?” A way to make them care more would be to play interesting animations when they solve each maze, so players might also ask the question: “I wonder what the next animation will be?”", "# Lens #5: The Lens of Endogenous Value\nTo use this lens, think about your players’ feelings about items, objects, and scoring in your game. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What is valuable to the players in my game?\n- How can I make it more valuable to them?\n- What is the relationship between value in the game and the player’s motivations?\n\nRemember, the value of the items and score in the game is a direct reflection of how much players care about succeeding in your game. By thinking about what the players really care about and why, you can often get insights about how your game can improve.", "# Lens #6: The Lens of Problem Solving\nTo use this lens, think about the problems your players must solve to suc- ceed at your game, for every game has problems to solve. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What problems does my game ask the player to solve?\n- Are there hidden problems to solve that arise as part of gameplay?\n- How can my game generate new problems so that players keep coming back?", "# Lens #7: The Lens of the Elemental Tetrad\nTo use this lens, take stock of what your game is truly made of. Consider each element separately, and then all of them together as a whole.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- Is my game design using elements of all four types?\n- Could my design be improved by enhancing elements in one or more of the categories?\n- Are the four elements in harmony, reinforcing each other, and working together toward a common theme?", "# Lens #8: The Lens of Holographic Design\nTo use this lens, you must see everything in your game at once: the four ele- ments and the player experience, as well as how they interrelate. It is accepta- ble to shift your focus from skin to skeleton and back again, but it is far better to view your game and experience holographically.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- What elements of the game make the experience enjoyable?\n- What elements of the game detract from the experience?\n- How can I change game elements to improve the experience?", "# Lens #9: The Lens of Unification\nTo use this lens, consider the reason behind it all. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What is my theme?\n- Am I using every means possible to reinforce that theme?\n\nThe Lens of Unification works very well with the Lens of the Elemental Tetrad. Use the tetrad to separate out the elements of your game, so you can more easily study them from the perspective of a unified theme.", "# Lens #10: The Lens of Resonance\nTo use the Lens of Resonance, you must look for hidden power. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What is it about my game that feels powerful and special?\n- When I describe my game to people, what ideas get them really excited?\n- If I had no constraints of any kind, what would this game be like?\n- I have certain instincts about how this game should be. What is driving those instincts?\n\nThe Lens of Resonance is a quiet, delicate instrument. It is a tool for listening to yourself and listening to others. We bury important things deep inside our- selves, and when something causes them to resonate, it shakes us to our very core. The fact that these things are hidden gives them power, but also makes them hard for us to find.", "# Lens #11: The Lens of Infinite Inspiration\n> When you know how to listen, everybody is the guru.\n> – Ram Dass To you use this lens, stop looking at your game, and stop looking at games\n> like it. Instead, look everywhere else.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- What is an experience I have had in my life that I would want to share with others?\n- In what small way can I capture the essence of that experience and put it into my game?", "# Lens #12: The Lens of the Problem Statement\nTo use this lens, think of your game as the solution to a problem. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What problem, or problems, am I really trying to solve?\n- Have I been making assumptions about this game that really have nothing to do with its true purpose?\n- Is a game really the best solution? Why?\n- How will I be able to tell if the problem is solved?\n\nDefining the constraints and goals for your game as a problem statement can help move you to a clear game design much more quickly.", "# Lens #13: The Lens of the Eight Filters\nTo use this lens, you must consider the many constraints your design must satisfy. You can only call your design finished when it can pass through all eight filters without requiring a change.\n\nAsk yourself the eight key questions:\n\n- Does this game feel right?\n- Will the intended audience like this game enough?\n- Is this a well-designed game?\n- Is this game novel enough?\n- Will this game sell?\n- Is it technically possible to build this game?\n- Does this game meet our social and community goals?\n- Do the playtesters enjoy this game enough?\n\nIn some situations, there may be still more filters; for example, an educa- tional game will also have to answer questions like “Does this game teach what it is supposed to?” If your design requires more filters, don’t neglect them.", "# Lens #14: The Lens of Risk Mitigation\nTo use this lens, stop thinking positively, and start seriously considering the things that could go horribly wrong with your game.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- What could keep this game from being great?\n- How can we stop that from happening?\n\nRisk management is hard. It means you have to face up to the problems you would most like to avoid, and solve them immediately. But if you disci- pline yourself to do it, you’ll loop more times, and more usefully, and get a better game as a result. It is tempting to ignore potential problems and just work on the parts of your game you feel most confident about. You must resist this temptation and focus on the parts of your game that are in danger.", "# Lens #15: The Lens of the Toy\nTo use this lens, stop thinking about whether your game is fun to play, and start thinking about whether it is fun to play with.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- If my game had no goal, would it be fun at all? If not, how can I change that?\n- When people see my game, do they want to start interacting with it, even before they know what to do? If not, how can I change that?\n\nThere are two ways to use the Lens of the Toy. One way is to use it on an existing game, to figure out how to add more toy-like qualities to it — that is, how to make it more approachable, and more fun to manipulate. But the sec- ond way, the braver way, is to use it to invent and create new toys before you even have any idea what games will be played with them. This is risky if you are on a schedule — but if you are not, it can be a great “divining rod” to help you find wonderful games you might not have discovered otherwise.", "# Lens #16: The Lens of the Player\nTo use this lens, stop thinking about your game, and start thinking about your player.\n\nAsk yourself these questions about the people who will play your game:\n\n- In general, what do they like?\n- What don’t they like? Why?\n- What do they expect to see in a game?\n- If I were in their place, what would I want to see in a game?\n- What would they like or dislike about my game in particular?\n\nA good game designer should always be thinking of the player, and should be an advocate for the player. Skilled designers hold The Lens of the Player and the Lens of Holographic Design in the same hand, thinking about the player, the experience of the game, and the mechanics of the game all at the same time. Thinking about the player is useful, but even more useful is watch- ing them play your game. The more you observe them playing, the more eas- ily you’ll be able to predict what they are going to enjoy.", "# Lens #17: The Lens of Pleasure\nTo use this lens, think about the kinds of pleasure your game does and does not provide.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- What pleasures does your game give to players? Can these be improved?\n- What pleasures are missing from your experience? Why? Can they be added?\n\nUltimately, the job of a game is to give pleasure. By going through lists of known pleasures, and considering how well your game delivers each one, you may be inspired to make changes to your game that will increase your players’ enjoyment. Always be on the lookout, though, for unique, unclassified pleas- ures not found in most games — for one of these might be what gives your game the unique quality it needs.", "# Lens #18: The Lens of Flow\nTo use this lens, consider what is holding your player’s focus. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- Does my game have clear goals? If not, how can I fix that?\n- Are the goals of the player the same goals I intended?\n- Are there parts of the game that distract players to the point they forget their goal? If so, can these distractions be reduced, or tied into the game goals?\n- Does my game provide a steady stream of not-too-easy, not-too-hard chal- lenges, taking into account the fact that the player’s skills may be gradually improving?\n- Are the player’s skills improving at the rate I had hoped? If not, how can I change that?", "# Lens #19: The Lens of Needs\nTo use this lens, stop thinking about your game, and start thinking about what basic human needs it fulfills.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- On which levels of Maslow’s hierarchy is my game operating?\n- How can I make my game fulfill more basic needs than it already is?\n- On the levels my game is currently operating, how can it fulfill those needs even better?\n\nIt sounds strange to talk about a game fulfilling basic human needs, but every- thing that people do is an attempt to fulfill these needs in some way. And keep in mind, some games fulfill needs better than others — your game can’t just promise the need, it must deliver fulfillment of the need. If a player imagines that playing your game is going to make them feel better about themselves, or get to know their friends better, and your game doesn’t deliver on these needs, your player will move on to a game that does.", "# Lens #20: The Lens of Judgment\nTo decide if your game is a good judge of the players, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What does your game judge about the players?\n- How does it communicate this judgment?\n- Do players feel the judgment is fair?\n- Do they care about the judgment?\n- Does the judgment make them want to improve?", "# Lens #21: The Lens of Functional Space\nTo use this lens, think about the space in which your game really takes place when all surface elements are stripped away.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- Is the space of this game discrete or continuous?\n- How many dimensions does it have?\n- What are the boundaries of the space?\n- Are there sub-spaces? How are they connected?\n- Is there more than one useful way to abstractly model the space of this game?", "# Lens #22: The Lens of Dynamic State\nTo use this lens, think about what information changes during your game, and who is aware of it. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What are the objects in my game?\n- What are the attributes of the objects?\n- What are the possible states for each attribute? What triggers the state changes for each attribute?\n- What state is known by the game only?\n- What state is known by all players?\n- What state is known by some, or only one player?\n- Would changing who knows what state improve my game in some way?\n\nGame playing is decision making. Decisions are made based on information. Deciding the different attributes, their states, and who knows about them is core to the mechanics of your game. Small changes to who knows what infor- mation can radically change a game, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. Who knows about what attributes can even change over the course of a game — a great way to create drama in your game is to make an impor- tant piece of private information suddenly become public.", "# Lens #23: The Lens of Emergence\nTo make sure your game has interesting qualities of emergence, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- How many verbs do my players have?\n- How many objects can each verb act on?\n- How many ways can players achieve their goals?\n- How many subjects do the players control?\n- How do side effects change constraints?", "# Lens #24: The Lens of Action\nTo use this lens, think about what your players can do and what they can’t, and why.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- What are the operational actions in my game?\n- What are the resultant actions?\n- What resultant actions would I like to see? How can I change my game in order to make those possible?\n- Am I happy with the ratio of resultant to operational actions?\n- What actions do players wish they could do in my game that they cannot? Can I somehow enable these, either as operational or resultant actions?\n\nA game without actions is like a sentence without verbs — nothing happens. Deciding the actions in your game will be the most fundamental decision you can make as a game designer. Tiny changes to these actions will have tre- mendous ripple effects with the possibility of either creating marvelous emer- gent gameplay or making a game that is predictable and tedious. Choose your actions carefully, and learn to listen to your game and your players to learn what is made possible by your choices.", "# Lens #25: The Lens of Goals\nTo ensure the goals of your game are appropriate and well-balanced, ask your- self these questions:\n\n- What is the ultimate goal of my game?\n- Is that goal clear to players?\n- If there is a series of goals, do the players understand that?\n- Are the different goals related to each other in a meaningful way?\n- Are my goals concrete, achievable, and rewarding?\n- Do I have a good balance of short- and long-term goals?\n- Do players have a chance to decide on their own goals?", "# Lens #26: The Lens of Rules\nTo use this lens, look deep into your game, until you can make out its most basic structure. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What are the foundational rules of my game? How do these differ from the operational rules?\n- Are there “laws” or “house rules” that are forming as the game develops? Should these be incorporated into my game directly?\n- Are there different modes in my game? Do these modes make things sim- pler, or more complex? Would the game be better with fewer modes? More modes?\n- Who enforces the rules?\n- Are the rules easy to understand, or is there confusion about them? If there is confusion, should I fix it by changing the rules or by explaining them more clearly?\n\nThere is a common misconception that designers make games by sitting down and writing a set of rules. This usually isn’t how it happens at all. A game’s rules are arrived at gradually and experimentally. The designer’s mind gener- ally works in the domain of “operational rules,” occasionally switching to the perspective of “foundational rules” when thinking about how to change or improve the game. The “written rules” usually come toward the end, once the game is playable. Part of the designer’s job is to make sure there are rules that cover every circumstance. Be sure to take careful notes as you playtest, because it is during these tests that holes in your rules will appear — if you just patch them quickly and don’t make a note, the same hole will just show up again later. A game is its rules — give them the time and consideration that they deserve.", "# Lens #27: The Lens of Skill\nTo use this lens, stop looking at your game, and start looking at the skills you are asking of your players.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- What skills does my game require from the player?\n- Are there categories of skill that this game is missing?\n- Which skills are dominant?\n- Are these skills creating the experience I want?\n- Are some players much better at these skills than others? Does this make the game feel unfair?\n- Can players improve their skills with practice?\n- Does this game demand the right level of skill?\n\nExercising skills can be a joyful thing — it is one of the reasons that people love games. Of course, it is only joyful if the skills are interesting and reward- ing, and if the challenge level strikes that ideal balance between “too easy” and “too hard.” Even dull skills (such as pushing buttons) can be made more interesting by dressing them up as virtual skills and providing the right level of challenge. Use this lens as a window into the experience the player is having. Because skills do so much to define experience, the Lens of Skill works quite well in conjunction with Lens #1: The Lens of Essential Experience.", "# Lens #28: The Lens of Expected Value\nTo use this lens, think about the chance of different events occurring in your game, and what those mean to your player.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- What is the actual chance of a certain event occurring?\n- What is the perceived chance?\n- What value does the outcome of that event have? Can the value be quanti- fied? Are there intangible aspects of value that I am not considering?\n- Each action a player can take has a different expected value when I add up all the possible outcomes. Am I happy with these values? Do they give the player interesting choices? Are they too rewarding, or too punishing?\n\nExpected value is one of your most valuable tools for analyzing game balance. The challenge of using it is finding a way to numerically represent everything that can happen to a player. Gaining and losing money is easy to represent. But what is the numerical value of “boots of speed” that let you run faster, or a “warp gate” that lets you skip two levels? These are difficult to quantify per- fectly — but that doesn’t mean you can’t take a guess. As we’ll see in Chapter 11, as you go through multiple iterations of game testing, tweaking parameters and values in your game, you will also be tweaking your own estimations of the values of different outcomes. Quantifying these less tangible elements can be quite enlightening, because it makes you think concretely about what is valuable to the player and why — and this concrete knowledge will put you in control of the balance of your game.", "# Lens #29: The Lens of Chance\nTo use this lens focus on the parts of your game that involve randomness and risk, keeping in mind that those two things are not the same.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- What in my game is truly random? What parts just feel random?\n- Does the randomness give the players positive feelings of excitement and challenge, or does it give them negative feelings of hopelessness and lack of control?\n- Would changing my probability distribution curves improve my game?\n- Do players have the opportunity to take interesting risks in the game?\n- What is the relationship between chance and skill in my game? Are there ways I can make random elements feel more like the exercise of a skill? Are there ways I can make exercising skills feel more like risk-taking?\n\nRisk and randomness are like spices. A game without any hint of them can be completely bland, but put in too much and they overwhelm everything else. But get them just right, and they bring out the flavor of everything else in your game. Unfortunately, using them in your game is not as simple as sprinkling them on top. You must look into your game to see where elements of risk and randomness naturally arise, and then decide how you can best tame them to do your bidding. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that elements of chance only occur around die rolls or randomly generated numbers. On the contrary, you can find them wherever a player encounters the unknown.", "# Lens #30: The Lens of Fairness\nTo use the Lens of Fairness, think carefully about the game from each player’s point of view. Taking into account each player’s skill level, find a way to give each player a chance of winning that each will consider to be fair.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- Should my game be symmetrical? Why?\n- Should my game be asymmetrical? Why?\n- Which is more important: that my game is a reliable measure of who has the most skill, or that it provide an interesting challenge to all players?\n- If I want players of different skill levels to play together, what means will I use to make the game interesting and challenging for everyone?\n\nFairness can be a slippery subject. There are some cases where one side has an advantage over the other, and the game still seems fair. Sometimes this is so that players of unequal skill can play together, but there can be other reasons. In the game Alien vs. Predator, for example, it is generally recognized that in multiplayer mode, Predators have a significant advantage over the Aliens. Players do not consider it to be unfair, however, because it is in keeping with the Alien vs. Predator story world, and they accept that if they play as an Alien, they will be at a disadvantage and will need to compensate for that with extra skill. It is a badge of pride among players to be able to win the game when playing as an Alien.", "# Lens #31: The Lens of Challenge\nChallenge is at the core of almost all gameplay. You could even say that a game is defined by its goals and its challenges. When examining the chal- lenges in your game, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What are the challenges in my game?\n- Are they too easy, too hard, or just right?\n- Can my challenges accommodate a wide variety of skill levels?\n- How does the level of challenge increase as the player succeeds?\n- Is there enough variety in the challenges?\n- What is the maximum level of challenge in my game?", "# Lens #32: The Lens of Meaningful Choices\nWhen we make meaningful choices, it lets us feel like the things we do matter. To use this lens, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What choices am I asking the player to make?\n- Are they meaningful? How?\n- Am I giving the player the right number of choices? Would more make them feel more powerful? Would less make the game clearer?\n- Are there any dominant strategies in my game?", "# Lens #33: The Lens of Triangularity\nGiving a player the choice to play it safe for a low reward, or to take a risk for a big reward is a great way to make your game interesting and exciting. To use the Lens of Triangularity, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- Do I have triangularity now? If not, how can I get it?\n- Is my attempt at triangularity balanced? That is, are the rewards commensurate with the risks?\n\nOnce you start looking for triangularity in games, you will see it everywhere. A dull, monotonous game can quickly become exciting and rewarding when you add a dash of triangularity.", "# Lens #34: The Lens of Skill vs. Chance\nTo help determine how to balance skill and chance in your game, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- Are my players here to be judged (skill), or to take risks (chance)?\n- Skill tends to be more serious than chance: Is my game serious or casual?\n- Are parts of my game tedious? If so, will adding elements of chance enliven them?\n- Do parts of my game feel too random? If so, will replacing elements of chance with elements of skill or strategy make the players feel more in control?", "# Lens #35: The Lens of Head and Hands\nYogi Berra once said “Baseball is 90% mental. The other half is physical.” To make sure your game has a more realistic balance of mental and physical ele- ments, use the Lens of Head and Hands. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- Are my players looking for mindless action, or an intellectual challenge?\n- Would adding more places that involve puzzle-solving in my game make it more interesting?\n- Are there places where the player can relax their brain, and just play the game without thinking?\n- Can I give the player a choice — either succeed by exercising a high level of dexterity, or by finding a clever strategy that works with a minimum of physical skill?\n- If “1” means all physical, and “10” means all mental, what number would my game get?\n- This lens works particularly well when used in conjunction with Lens #16: Lens of the Player.", "# Lens #36: The Lens of Competition\nDetermining who is most skilled at something is a basic human urge. Games of competition can satisfy that urge. Use this lens to be sure your competitive game makes people want to win it. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- Does my game give a fair measurement of player skill?\n- Do people want to win my game? Why?\n- Is winning this game something people can be proud of? Why?\n- Can novices meaningfully compete at my game?\n- Can experts meaningfully compete at my game?\n- Can experts generally be sure they will defeat novices?", "# Lens #37: The Lens of Cooperation\nCollaborating and succeeding as a team is a special pleasure that can create lasting social bonds. Use this lens to study the cooperative aspects of your game. Ask these questions:\n\n- Cooperation requires communication. Do my players have enough opportu- nity to communicate? How could communication be enhanced?\n- Are my players friends already, or are they strangers? If they are strangers, can I help them break the ice?\n- Is there synergy (2 + 2 = 5) or antergy (2 + 2 = 3)when the players work together? Why?\n- Do all the players have the same role, or do they have special jobs?\n- Cooperation is greatly enhanced when there is no way an individual can do a task alone. Does my game have tasks like that?\n- Tasks that force communication inspire cooperation. Do any of my tasks force communication?", "# Lens #38: The Lens of Competition vs. Cooperation\nBalancing competition and cooperation can be done in many interesting ways. Use this lens to decide whether they are balanced properly in your game. Ask these questions:\n\n- If “1” is Competition and “10” is Cooperation, what number should my game get?\n- Can I give players a choice whether to play cooperatively or competitively?\n- Does my audience prefer competition, cooperation, or a mix?\n- Is team competition something that makes sense for my game? Is my game more fun with team competition, or with solo competition?", "# Lens #39: The Lens of Time\nIt is said that “timing is everything.” Our goal as designers is to create experi- ences, and experiences are easily spoiled when they are too short or too long. Ask these questions to make yours just the right length:\n\n- What is it that determines the length of my gameplay activities?\n- Are my players frustrated because the game ends too early? How can I change that?\n- Are my players bored because the game goes on for too long? How can I change that?\n- Setting a time limit can make gameplay more exciting. Is it a good idea for my game?\n- Would a hierarchy of time structures help my game? That is, several short rounds that together comprise a larger round? Timing can be very difficult to get right, but it can make or break a game. Often, it makes sense to follow the old vaudevillian adage of “Leave ’em want- ing more.”", "# Lens #40: The Lens of Reward\nEveryone likes to be told they are doing a good job. Ask these questions to determine if your game is giving out the right rewards in the right amounts at the right times:\n\n- What rewards is my game giving out now? Can it give out others as well?\n- Are players excited when they get rewards in my game, or are they bored by them? Why?\n- Getting a reward you don’t understand is like getting no reward at all. Do my players understand the rewards they are getting?\n- Are the rewards my game gives out too regular? Can they be given out in a more variable way?\n- How are my rewards related to one another? Is there a way that they could be better connected?\n- How are my rewards building? Too fast, too slow, or just right? Balancing rewards is different for every game. Not only does a designer have to worry about giving out the right ones, but giving them at the right times in the right amounts. This can only be determined through trial and error — even then, it probably won’t be right for everyone. When trying to balance rewards, it is hard to be perfect — you often have to settle for “good enough.”", "# Lens #41: The Lens of Punishment\nPunishment must be used delicately, since after all, players are in a game of their own free will. Balanced appropriately, it will give everything in your game more meaning, and players will have a real sense of pride when they succeed at your game. To examine the punishment in your game, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What are the punishments in my game?\n- Why am I punishing the players? What do I hope to achieve by it?\n- Do my punishments seem fair to the players? Why or why not?\n- Is there a way to turn these punishments into rewards and get the same, or a better effect?\n- Are my strong punishments balanced against commensurately strong rewards?", "# Lens #42: The Lens of Simplicity/Complexity\nStriking the right balance between simplicity and complexity is difficult and must be done for the right reasons. Use this lens to help your game become one in which meaningful complexity arises out of a simple system. Ask your- self these questions:\n\n- What elements of innate complexity do I have in my game?\n- Is there a way this innate complexity could be turned into emergent complexity?\n- Do elements of emergent complexity arise from my game? If not, why not?\n- Are there elements of my game that are too simple?", "# Lens #43: The Lens of Elegance\nMost “classic games” are considered to be masterpieces of elegance. Use this lens to make your game as elegant as possible. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What are the elements of my game?\n- What are the purposes of each element? Count these up to give the element an “elegance rating.”\n- For elements with only one or two purposes, can some of these be com- bined into each other, or removed altogether?\n- For elements with several purposes, is it possible for them to take on even more?", "# Lens #44: The Lens of Character\nElegance and character are opposites. They are like miniature versions of sim- plicity and complexity, and must be kept in balance. To make sure your game has lovable, defining quirks, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- Is there anything strange in my game that players talk about excitedly?\n- Does my game have funny qualities that make it unique?\n- Does my game have flaws that players like?", "# Lens #45: The Lens of Imagination\nAll games have some element of imagination and some element of connection to reality. Use this lens to help find the balance between detail and imagina- tion. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What must the player understand to play my game?\n- Can some element of imagination help them understand that better?\n- What high-quality, realistic details can we provide in this game?\n- What details would be low quality if we provided them? Can imagination fill the gap instead?\n- Can I give details that the imagination will be able to reuse again and again?\n- What details I provide inspire imagination?\n- What details I provide stifle imagination?", "# Lens #46: The Lens of Economy\nGiving a game an economy can give it surprising depth and a life all its own. But like all living things, it can be difficult to control. Use this lens to keep your economy in balance:\n\n- How can my players earn money? Should there be other ways?\n- What can my players buy? Why?\n- Is money too easy to get? Too hard? How can I change this?\n- Are choices about earning and spending meaningful ones?\n- Is a universal currency a good idea in my game, or should there be special- ized currencies?", "# Lens #47: The Lens of Balance\nThere are many types of game balance, and each is important. However, it is easy to get lost in the details and forget the big picture. Use this simple lens to get out of the mire, and ask yourself the only important question:\n\n- Does my game feel right? Why or why not?", "# Lens #48: The Lens of Accessibility\nWhen you present a puzzle to players (or a game of any kind), they should be able to clearly visualize what their first few steps would be. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- How will players know how to begin solving my puzzle, or playing my game? Do I need to explain it, or is it self-evident?\n- Does my puzzle or game act like something they have seen before? If it does, how can I draw attention to that similarity. If it does not, how can I make them understand how it does behave?\n- Does my puzzle or game draw people in, and make them want to touch it and manipulate it? If not, how I can I change it so that it does?", "# Lens #49: The Lens of Visible Progress\nPlayers need to see that they are making progress when solving a difficult prob- lem. To make sure they are getting this feedback, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What does it mean to make progress in my game or puzzle?\n- Is there enough progress in my game? Is there a way I can add more interim steps of progressive success?\n- What progress is visible, and what progress is hidden? Can I find a way to reveal what is hidden?", "# Lens #50: The Lens of Parallelism\nParallelism in your puzzle brings parallel benefits to the player’s experience. To use this lens, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- Are there bottlenecks in my design where players are unable to proceed if they cannot solve a particular challenge? If so, can I add parallel challenges for a player to work on when this challenge stumps them?\n- If parallel challenges are too similar, the parallelism offers little benefit. Are my parallel challenges different enough from each other to give players the benefit of variety?\n- Can my parallel challenges be connected somehow? Is there a way that making progress on one can make it easier to solve the others?", "# Lens #51: The Lens of the Pyramid\nPyramids fascinate us because they have a singular highest point. To give your puzzle the allure of the ancient pyramids, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- Is there a way all the pieces of my puzzle can feed into a singular challenge at the end?\n- Big pyramids are often made of little pyramids — can I have a hierarchy of ever more challenging puzzle elements, gradually leading to a final challenge?\n- Is the challenge at the top of my pyramid interesting, compelling, and clear? Does it make people want to work in order to get to it?", "# Lens #52: The Lens of the Puzzle\nPuzzles make the player stop and think. To ensure your puzzles are doing eve- rything you want to shape the player experience, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What are the puzzles in my game?\n- Should I have more puzzles, or less? Why?\n- Which of the ten puzzle principles apply to each of my puzzles?\n- Do I have any incongruous puzzles? How can I better integrate them into the game? (Use Lens #43: The Lens of Elegance to help do this).\n\nIn the last few chapters, we have focused on game internals — it is now time to consider an external element — the interface of the game.?", "# Lens #53: The Lens of Control\nThis lens has uses beyond just examining your interface, since meaningful control is essential for immersive interactivity. To use this lens, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- When players use the interface, does it do what is expected? If not, why not?\n- Intuitive interfaces give a feeling of control. Is your interface easy to master, or hard to master?\n- Do your players feel they have a strong influence over the outcome of the game? If not, how can you change that?\n- Feeling powerful  feeling in control. Do your players feel powerful? Can you make them feel more powerful somehow?", "#Lens #54: The Lens of Physical Interface\nSomehow, the player has a physical interaction with your game. Copying exist- ing physical interfaces is an easy trap to fall into. Use this lens to be sure that your physical interface is well-suited to your game by asking these questions:\n\n- What does the player pick up and touch? Can this be made more pleasing?\n- How does this map to the actions in the game world? Can the mapping be more direct?\n- If you can’t create a custom physical interface, what metaphor are you using when you map the inputs to the game world?\n- How does the physical interface look under the Lens of the Toy?\n- How does the player see, hear, and touch the world of the game? Is there a way to include a physical output device that will make the world become more real in the player’s imagination? The world of videogames occasionally goes through dry spells where designers feel it is not feasible to create custom physical interfaces. But the marketplace thrives on experimentation and novelty, and suddenly specially crafted physical interfaces, like the Dance Dance Revolution mat, the Guitar Hero guitar, and the Wiimote appear, bringing new life to old gameplay by giv- ing players a new way to interact with old game mechanics.", "# Lens #55: The Lens of Virtual Interface\nDesigning virtual interfaces can be very tricky. Done poorly, they become a wall between the player and the game world. Done well, they amplify the power and control a player has in the game world. Ask these questions to make sure that your virtual interface is enhancing player experience as much as possible:\n\n- What information does a player need to receive that isn’t obvious just by looking at the game world?\n- When does the player need this information? All the time? Only occasion- ally? Only at the end of a level?\n- How can this information be delivered to the player in a way that won’t interfere with the player’s interactions with the game world?", "# Lens #56: The Lens of Transparency\nThe ideal interface becomes invisible to the player letting the player’s imagi- nation be completely immersed in the game world. To ensure invisibility, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What are the players desires? Does the interface let the players do what they want?\n- Is the interface simple enough that with practice, players will be able to use it without thinking?\n- Do new players find the interface intuitive? If not, can it be made more intui- tive, somehow? Would allowing players to customize the controls help, or hurt?\n- Does the interface work well in all situations, or are there cases (near a corner, going very fast, etc.) when it behaves in ways that will confuse the player?\n- Can players continue to use the interface well in stressful situations, or do they start fumbling with the controls, or missing crucial information? If so, how can this be improved?\n- Does something confuse players about the interface? On which of the six interface arrows is it happening?", "# Lens #57: The Lens of Feedback\nThe feedback a player gets from the game is many things: judgment, reward, instruction, encouragement, and challenge. Use this lens to be sure your feed- back loop is creating the experience you want by asking these questions at every moment in your game:\n\n- What do players need to know at this moment?\n- What do players want to know at this moment?\n- What do you want players to feel at this moment? How can you give feed- back that creates that feeling?\n- What do the players want to feel at this moment? Is there an opportunity for them to create a situation where they will feel that?\n- What is the player’s goal at this moment? What feedback will help them toward that goal?\n\nUsing this lens takes some effort, since feedback in a game is continuous, but needs to be different in different situations. It takes a lot of mental effort to use this lens in every moment of your game, but it is time well spent, because it will help guarantee that the game is clear, challenging, and rewarding.", "# Lens #58: The Lens of Juiciness\nTo call an interface “juicy” might seem kind of silly — although it is very com- mon to hear an interface with very little feedback described as “dry.” Juicy interfaces are fun the moment you pick them up. To maximize juiciness, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- Is my interface giving the player continuous feedback for their actions? If not, why not?\n- Is second-order motion created by the actions of the player? Is this motion powerful and interesting?\n- Juicy systems reward the player many ways at once. When I give the player a reward, how many ways am I simultaneously rewarding them? Can I find more ways?", "# Lens #59: The Lens of Channels and Dimensions\nChoosing how to map game information to channels and dimensions is the heart of designing your game interface. Use this lens to make sure you do it thoughtfully and well. Ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What data need to travel to and from the player?\n- Which data are most important?\n- What channels do I have available to transmit this data?\n- Which channels are most appropriate for which data? Why?\n- Which dimensions are available on the different channels?\n- How should I use those dimensions?", "# Lens #60: The Lens of Modes\nAn interface of any complexity is going to require modes. To make sure your modes make the player feel powerful and in control and do not confuse or overwhelm, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What modes do I need in my game? Why?\n- Can any modes be collapsed, or combined?\n- Are any of the modes overlapping? If so, can I put them on different input channels?\n- When the game changes modes, how does the player know that? Can the game communicate the mode change in more than one way?", "# Lens #61: The Lens of the Interest Curve\nExactly what captivates the human mind often seems different for every per- son, but the most pleasurable patterns of that captivation are remarkably similar for everyone. To see how a player’s interest in your experience changes over time, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- If I draw an interest curve of my experience, how is it generally shaped?\n- Does it have a hook?\n- Does it have gradually rising interest, punctuated by periods of rest?\n- Is there a grand finale, more interesting than everything else?\n- What changes would give me a better interest curve?\n- Is there a fractal structure to my interest curve? Should there be?\n- Do my intuitions about the interest curve match the observed interest of the players? If I ask playtesters to draw an interest curve, what does it look like? Since all players are different, you may find it quite useful to use the Lens of the Interest Curve and Lens #16: The Lens of the Player at the same time, creating a unique interest curve for each of the types of players your game is trying to reach.", "# Lens #62: The Lens of Inherent Interest\nSome things are just interesting. Use this lens to be sure your game has inher- ently interesting qualities by asking these questions:\n\n- What aspects of my game will capture the interest of a player immediately?\n- Does my game let the player see or do something they have never seen or done before?\n- What base instincts does my game appeal to? Can it appeal to more of them?\n- What higher instincts does my game appeal to? Can it appeal to more of those?\n- Does dramatic change and anticipation of dramatic change happen in my game? How can it be more dramatic?", "# Lens #63: The Lens of Beauty\nWe love to experience things of great beauty. Use this lens to make your game a joy forever by asking yourself these questions:\n\n- What elements make up my game? How can each one can be more beautiful?\n- Some things are not beautiful in themselves, but are beautiful in combi- nation. How can the elements of my game be composed in a way that is poetic and beautiful?\n- What does beauty mean within the context of my game?", "# Lens #64: The Lens of Projection\nOne key indicator that someone is enjoying an experience is that they have projected their imaginations into it. When they do this, their enjoyment of the experience increases significantly, in a sort of virtuous circle. To examine whether your game is well-suited to induce projection from your players, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What is there in my game that players can relate to? What else can I add?\n- What is there in my game that will capture a player’s imagination? What else can I add?\n- Are there places in the game that players have always wanted to visit?\n- Does the player get to be a character they could imagine themselves to be?\n- Are there other characters in the game that the players would be interested to meet (or to spy on)?\n- Do the players get to do things that they would like to do in real life, but can’t?\n- Is there an activity in the game that once a player starts doing, it is hard to stop?", "# Lens #65: The Lens of the Story Machine\nA good game is a machine that generates stories when people play it. To make sure your story machine is as productive as possible, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- When players have different choices about how to achieve goals, new and different stories can arise. How can I add more of these choices?\n- Different conflicts lead to different stories. How can I allow more types of conflict to arise from my game?\n- When players can personalize the characters and setting, they will care more about story outcomes, and similar stories can start to feel very differ- ent. How can I let players personalize the story?\n- Good stories have good interest curves. Do my rules lead to stories with good interest curves?\n- A story is only good if you can tell it. Who can your players tell the story to that will actually care?", "# Lens #66: The Lens of the Obstacle\nA goal with no obstacles is not worth pursuing. Use this lens to make sure your obstacles are ones that your players will want to overcome.\n\n- What is the relationship between the main character and the goal? Why does the character care about it?\n- What are the obstacles between the character and the goal?\n- Is there an antagonist who is behind the obstacles? What is the relationship between the protagonist and the antagonist?\n- Do the obstacles gradually increase in difficulty?\n- Some say “The bigger the obstacle, the better the story.” Are your obstacles big enough? Can they be bigger?\n- Great stories often involve the protagonist transforming in order to over- come the obstacle. How does your protagonist transform?", "# Lens #67: The Lens of Simplicity and Transcendence\nTo make sure you have the right mix of simplicity and transcendence, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- How is my world simpler than the real world? Can it be simpler in other ways?\n- What kind of transcendent power do I give to the player? How can I give even more without removing challenge from the game?\n- Is my combination of simplicity and transcendence contrived, or does it provide my players with a special kind of wish fulfillment?", "# Lens #68: The Lens of the Hero’s Journey\nMany heroic stories have similar structure. Use this lens to make sure you haven’t missed out on any elements that might improve your story. Ask your- self these questions:\n\n- Does my story have elements that qualify it as a heroic story?\n- If so, how does it match up with the structure of the Hero’s Journey?\n- Would my story be improved by including more archetypical elements?\n- Does my story match this form so closely that it feels hackneyed?", "# Lens #69: The Lens of the Weirdest Thing\nHaving weird things in your story can help give meaning to unusual game mechanics — it can capture the interest of the player, and it can make your world seem special. Too many things that are too weird, though, will render your story puzzling and inaccessible. To make sure your story is the good kind of weird, ask yourself these questions:\n\n- What’s the weirdest thing in my story?\n- How can I make sure that the weirdest thing doesn’t confuse or alienate the player?\n- If there are multiple weird things, should I may be get rid of, or coalesce, some of them?\n- If there is nothing weird in my story, is the story still interesting?", "# Lens #70: The Lens of Story\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- Does my game really need a story? Why?\n- Why will players be interested in this story?\n- How does the story support the other parts of the tetrad (aesthetics, tech- nology, gameplay)? Can it do a better job?\n- How do the other parts of the tetrad support the story? Can they do a better job?\n- How can my story be better?", "# Lens #71: The Lens of Freedom\nA feeling of freedom is one of the things that separates games from other forms of entertainment.

One way to do this is to create a graph with one axis labeled hostile/friendly, and the other labeled submissive/dominant. Pick a character to analyze, and put them in the middle. Plot out where other characters lie relative to that character, and ask yourself these questions:\n\n- Are there any gaps in the chart? Why are they there? Would it be better if the gaps were filled?\n- Are there “extreme characters” on the graph? If not, would it be better if there were?\n- Are the character’s friends in the same quadrant, or different quadrants?
