  # Lens #1: The Lens of Essential Experience
  To use this lens, you stop thinking about your game and start thinking about the experience of the player. Ask yourself these questions:

  - What experience do I want the player to have?
  - What is essential to that experience?
  - How can my game capture that essence?

  If there is a big difference between the experience you want to create and the one you are actually creating, your game needs to change: You need to clearly state the essential experience you desire, and find as many ways as possible to instill this essence into your game.
