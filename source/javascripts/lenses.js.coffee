  # Lens #1: The Lens of Essential Experience
  To use this lens, you stop thinking about your game and start thinking about the experience of the player. Ask yourself these questions:

  - What experience do I want the player to have?
  - What is essential to that experience?
  - How can my game capture that essence?

  If there is a big difference between the experience you want to create and the one you are actually creating, your game needs to change: You need to clearly state the essential experience you desire, and find as many ways as possible to instill this essence into your game.

  # Lens #2: The Lens of Surprise
  Surprise is so basic that we can easily forget about it. Use this lens to remind yourself to fill your game with interesting surprises. Ask yourself these questions:

  - What will surprise players when they play my game?
  - Does the story in my game have surprises? Do the game rules? Does the artwork? The technology?
  - Do your rules give players ways to surprise each other?
  - Do your rules give players ways to surprise themselves?

  Surprise is a crucial part of all entertainment — it is at the root of humor, strategy, and problem solving. Our brains are hardwired to enjoy surprises. In an experiment where participants received sprays of sugar water or plain water into their mouths, the participants who received random sprays consid- ered the experience much more pleasurable than participants who received the sprays according to a fixed pattern, even though the same amount of sugar was delivered. In other experiments, brain scans revealed that even during unpleasant surprises, the pleasure centers of the brain are triggered.

  # Lens #3: The Lens of Fun
  Fun is desirable in nearly every game, although sometimes fun defies analysis. To maximize your game’s fun, ask yourself these questions:

  - What parts of my game are fun? Why?
  - What parts need to be more fun?
  """
  """
  # Lens #4: The Lens of Curiosity
  To use this lens, think about the player’s true motivations — not just the goals your game has set forth, but the reason the player wants to achieve those goals. Ask yourself these questions:

  - What questions does my game put into the player’s mind?
  - What am I doing to make them care about these questions?
  - What can I do to make them invent even more questions?

  For example, a maze-finding videogame might have a time-limit goal such that at each level, players are trying to answer the question: “Can I find my way through this maze in 30 seconds?” A way to make them care more would be to play interesting animations when they solve each maze, so players might also ask the question: “I wonder what the next animation will be?”
  """
  """
  # Lens #5: The Lens of Endogenous Value
  To use this lens, think about your players’ feelings about items, objects, and scoring in your game. Ask yourself these questions:

  - What is valuable to the players in my game?
  - How can I make it more valuable to them?
  - What is the relationship between value in the game and the player’s motivations?

  Remember, the value of the items and score in the game is a direct reflection of how much players care about succeeding in your game. By thinking about what the players really care about and why, you can often get insights about how your game can improve.
  """
  """
  # Lens #6: The Lens of Problem Solving
  To use this lens, think about the problems your players must solve to suc- ceed at your game, for every game has problems to solve. Ask yourself these questions:

  - What problems does my game ask the player to solve?
  - Are there hidden problems to solve that arise as part of gameplay?
  - How can my game generate new problems so that players keep coming back?
  """
  """
  # Lens #7: The Lens of the Elemental Tetrad
  To use this lens, take stock of what your game is truly made of. Consider each element separately, and then all of them together as a whole.

  Ask yourself these questions:

  - Is my game design using elements of all four types?
  - Could my design be improved by enhancing elements in one or more of the categories?
  - Are the four elements in harmony, reinforcing each other, and working together toward a common theme?
  """
  """
  # Lens #8: The Lens of Holographic Design
  To use this lens, you must see everything in your game at once: the four ele- ments and the player experience, as well as how they interrelate. It is accepta- ble to shift your focus from skin to skeleton and back again, but it is far better to view your game and experience holographically.

  Ask yourself these questions:

  - What elements of the game make the experience enjoyable?
  - What elements of the game detract from the experience?
  - How can I change game elements to improve the experience?
  """
  """
  # Lens #9: The Lens of Unification
  To use this lens, consider the reason behind it all. Ask yourself these questions:

  - What is my theme?
  - Am I using every means possible to reinforce that theme?

  The Lens of Unification works very well with the Lens of the Elemental Tetrad. Use the tetrad to separate out the elements of your game, so you can more easily study them from the perspective of a unified theme.
  """
  """
  # Lens #10: The Lens of Resonance
  To use the Lens of Resonance, you must look for hidden power. Ask yourself these questions:

  - What is it about my game that feels powerful and special?
  - When I describe my game to people, what ideas get them really excited?
  - If I had no constraints of any kind, what would this game be like?
  - I have certain instincts about how this game should be. What is driving those instincts?

  The Lens of Resonance is a quiet, delicate instrument. It is a tool for listening to yourself and listening to others. We bury important things deep inside our- selves, and when something causes them to resonate, it shakes us to our very core. The fact that these things are hidden gives them power, but also makes them hard for us to find.

  # Lens #11: The Lens of Infinite Inspiration
  > When you know how to listen, everybody is the guru.
  > – Ram Dass To you use this lens, stop looking at your game, and stop looking at games
  > like it. Instead, look everywhere else.

  Ask yourself these questions:

  - What is an experience I have had in my life that I would want to share with others?
  - In what small way can I capture the essence of that experience and put it into my game?
  """
  """
  # Lens #12: The Lens of the Problem Statement
  To use this lens, think of your game as the solution to a problem. Ask yourself these questions:

  - What problem, or problems, am I really trying to solve?
  - Have I been making assumptions about this game that really have nothing to do with its true purpose?
  - Is a game really the best solution? Why?
  - How will I be able to tell if the problem is solved?

  Defining the constraints and goals for your game as a problem statement can help move you to a clear game design much more quickly.
  """
  """
  # Lens #13: The Lens of the Eight Filters
  To use this lens, you must consider the many constraints your design must satisfy. You can only call your design finished when it can pass through all eight filters without requiring a change.

  Ask yourself the eight key questions:

  - Does this game feel right?
  - Will the intended audience like this game enough?
  - Is this a well-designed game?
  - Is this game novel enough?
  - Will this game sell?
  - Is it technically possible to build this game?
  - Does this game meet our social and community goals?
  - Do the playtesters enjoy this game enough?

  In some situations, there may be still more filters; for example, an educa- tional game will also have to answer questions like “Does this game teach what it is supposed to?” If your design requires more filters, don’t neglect them.
  """
  """
  # Lens #14: The Lens of Risk Mitigation
  To use this lens, stop thinking positively, and start seriously considering the things that could go horribly wrong with your game.

  Ask yourself these questions:

  - What could keep this game from being great?
  - How can we stop that from happening?

  Risk management is hard. It means you have to face up to the problems you would most like to avoid, and solve them immediately. But if you disci- pline yourself to do it, you’ll loop more times, and more usefully, and get a better game as a result. It is tempting to ignore potential problems and just work on the parts of your game you feel most confident about. You must resist this temptation and focus on the parts of your game that are in danger.

  # Lens #15: The Lens of the Toy
  To use this lens, stop thinking about whether your game is fun to play, and start thinking about whether it is fun to play with.

  Ask yourself these questions:

  - If my game had no goal, would it be fun at all? If not, how can I change that?
  - When people see my game, do they want to start interacting with it, even before they know what to do? If not, how can I change that?

  There are two ways to use the Lens of the Toy. One way is to use it on an existing game, to figure out how to add more toy-like qualities to it — that is, how to make it more approachable, and more fun to manipulate. But the sec- ond way, the braver way, is to use it to invent and create new toys before you even have any idea what games will be played with them. This is risky if you are on a schedule — but if you are not, it can be a great “divining rod” to help you find wonderful games you might not have discovered otherwise.
  """
  """
  # Lens #16: The Lens of the Player
  To use this lens, stop thinking about your game, and start thinking about your player.

  Ask yourself these questions about the people who will play your game:

  - In general, what do they like?
  - What don’t they like? Why?
  - What do they expect to see in a game?
  - If I were in their place, what would I want to see in a game?
  - What would they like or dislike about my game in particular?

  A good game designer should always be thinking of the player, and should be an advocate for the player. Skilled designers hold The Lens of the Player and the Lens of Holographic Design in the same hand, thinking about the player, the experience of the game, and the mechanics of the game all at the same time. Thinking about the player is useful, but even more useful is watch- ing them play your game. The more you observe them playing, the more eas- ily you’ll be able to predict what they are going to enjoy.
  """
  """
  # Lens #17: The Lens of Pleasure
  To use this lens, think about the kinds of pleasure your game does and does not provide.

  Ask yourself these questions:

  - What pleasures does your game give to players? Can these be improved?
  - What pleasures are missing from your experience? Why? Can they be added?

  Ultimately, the job of a game is to give pleasure. By going through lists of known pleasures, and considering how well your game delivers each one, you may be inspired to make changes to your game that will increase your players’ enjoyment. Always be on the lookout, though, for unique, unclassified pleas- ures not found in most games — for one of these might be what gives your game the unique quality it needs.
  """
  """
  # Lens #18: The Lens of Flow
  To use this lens, consider what is holding your player’s focus. Ask yourself these questions:

  - Does my game have clear goals? If not, how can I fix that?
  - Are the goals of the player the same goals I intended?
  - Are there parts of the game that distract players to the point they forget their goal? If so, can these distractions be reduced, or tied into the game goals?
  - Does my game provide a steady stream of not-too-easy, not-too-hard chal- lenges, taking into account the fact that the player’s skills may be gradually improving?
  - Are the player’s skills improving at the rate I had hoped? If not, how can I change that?
  """
  """
  # Lens #19: The Lens of Needs
  To use this lens, stop thinking about your game, and start thinking about what basic human needs it fulfills.

  Ask yourself these questions:

  - On which levels of Maslow’s hierarchy is my game operating?
  - How can I make my game fulfill more basic needs than it already is?
  - On the levels my game is currently operating, how can it fulfill those needs even better?

  It sounds strange to talk about a game fulfilling basic human needs, but every- thing that people do is an attempt to fulfill these needs in some way. And keep in mind, some games fulfill needs better than others — your game can’t just promise the need, it must deliver fulfillment of the need. If a player imagines that playing your game is going to make them feel better about themselves, or get to know their friends better, and your game doesn’t deliver on these needs, your player will move on to a game that does.
  """
  """
  # Lens #20: The Lens of Judgment
  To decide if your game is a good judge of the players, ask yourself these questions:

  - What does your game judge about the players?
  - How does it communicate this judgment?
  - Do players feel the judgment is fair?
  - Do they care about the judgment?
  - Does the judgment make them want to improve?
