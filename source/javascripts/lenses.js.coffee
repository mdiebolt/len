  To use this lens, you stop thinking about your game and start thinking about the experience of the player. Ask yourself these questions:
  * What experience do I want the player to have?
  * What is essential to that experience?
  * How can my game capture that essence?
  If there is a big difference between the experience you want to create and the one you are actually creating, your game needs to change: You need to clearly state the essential experience you desire, and find as many ways as possible to instill this essence into your game.

  Surprise is so basic that we can easily forget about it. Use this lens to remind yourself to fill your game with interesting surprises. Ask yourself these questions:
  * What will surprise players when they play my game?
  * Does the story in my game have surprises? Do the game rules? Does the artwork? The technology?

  Fun is desirable in nearly every game, although sometimes fun defies analysis. To maximize your gameâ€™s fun, ask yourself these questions:
  * What parts of my game are fun? Why?
  * What parts need to be more fun?
